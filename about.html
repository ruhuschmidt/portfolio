<p id= "fun">I grew up in the mountains and have a love for the outdoors, skiing and hiking. They were big influences in my early years and are still some of my favorites hobbies. Along with that, curling up with a good book is an excellent way to pass time, for me. I also enjoy crafting, drawing, painting and sewing and just creating things with my hands in general. Baking is also a favorite activity and a great way to exercises my taste buds!

<p id="school">Currently, I am a sophomore at University of Colorado Boulder studying Technology, Arts and Media (TAM), a relatively new major at CU.  In TAM we learn many skills ranging from graphic design to coding to 3D modeling to web design and much more. I really love how this major takes aspect of engineering and combines them with artistic expression and ideas. It has given me a chance to express my creatives and crafting which is important to me. I have loved learning about design and how important and crucial it is in the world to produce good work.
